        <h1>The 5 Types of Impostor Syndrome</h1>
        <section id="Perfectionist" class="main-section">
            <header>Perfectionist</header>
            <p>Primary focus is on “how” something is done. This includes how the work is conducted and how it turns out.</p>
            <code>print("The Perfectionist")</code>
            <p>One minor flaw in an otherwise stellar performance or 99 out of 100 equals failure and thus shame.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Expert" class="main-section">
            <header>Expert</header>
            <p>The knowledge version of the Perfectionist. Here, the primary concern is on “what” and “how much” you know or can do.</p>
            <code>print("The Expert")</code>
            <p>Because you expect to know everything, even a minor lack of knowledge denotes failure and shame.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Soloist" class="main-section">
            <header>Soloist</header>
            <p>Cares mostly about “who” completes the task. To make it on the achievement list, it has to be you and you alone.</p>
            <code> print("The Soloist")</code>
            <p>Because you think you need to do and figure out everything on your own, needing help is a sign of failure that evokes shame.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Genius" class="main-section">
            <header>Genius</header>
            <p>Cares about “how” and “when” accomplishments happen. But for you, competence is measured in terms of ease and speed.</p>
            <code>print("The Natural Genius")</code>
            <p>The fact that you have to struggle to master a subject or skill or that you’re not able to bang out your masterpiece on the first try equals failure which evokes shame.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Superhuman" class="main-section">
            <header>Superhuman</header>
            <p>Measures competence based on “how many” roles they can both juggle and excel in.</p>
            <code>print("The Superman")</code>
            <p>Falling short in any role — as a manager, team member, parent, partner, friend, volunteer — all evoke shame because they feel they should be able to handle it all — perfectly and easily.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try not to let emotions of worthlessness or uncertainty control your actions; instead, embrace your fears and move forward.</li>
                <li>Consider your accomplishments in the past as proof against impostor syndrome, and utilize them as a fallback when you start to doubt your abilities.</li>
                <li>Build a rapport with a counselor who can assist you in identifying false ideas that perpetuate impostor syndrome.</li>
                <li>As a reminder of your belonging, create areas where your identities are honored and expressed.</li>
                <li>Help others reject impostor beliefs by reflecting back to them their values, abilities, and talents; assisting others may also work as a beneficial reminder for you.</li>
            </ul>
